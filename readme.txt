BINGO HUSKY DOCUMENTATION MK2
- Athena Equinox

Current Plans for the Project

1. Athena is working with Fletcher (hopefully) to source the battery

2. All other team members should work through the tutorials located here
https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/kinetic/ros/Practical%20Example.html
in order to begin understanding how the ROS operating system works

You will problably need to update everything based on this 
http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Source

https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html
This tutorial may be useful but attempt the clearpath tutorials first and return to these if you get confused
